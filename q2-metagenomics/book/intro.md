# Metagenome analysis with QIIME 2

```{warning}
Metagenomics analysis with QIIME 2 is in alpha release and this documentation is a work in progress. ðŸšœ

This means that results you generate should be considered preliminary, and NOT PUBLICATION QUALITY.
Additionally, interfaces are subject to change, and those changes may be backward incompatible (meaning that a command or file that works in one version of the QIIME 2 Metagenomics distribution may not work in the next version of that distribution).

Thanks for trying this out - we're very interested in your feedback on what would make this functionality more useful for your workflows.
