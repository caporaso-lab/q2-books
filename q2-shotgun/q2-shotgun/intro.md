# Shotgun metagenomics analysis with QIIME 2

```{warning}
Shotgun metagenomics analysis with QIIME 2 is in alpha release.
This means that results you generate should be considered preliminary, and NOT PUBLICATION QUALITY.
Additionally, interfaces are subject to change, and those changes may be backward incompatible (meaning that a command or file that works in one version of the QIIME 2 Shotgun Metagenomics distribution may not work in the next version of that distribution).
